This is a directory of my new scientific writings since Blockchain
-Two rejected papers about Bitcoin stateless nodes(contribution was considered too minor or in early steps for the 2nd as it was WIP)
One was about partitioning the UTXO set, the second was about providing/adding Fraud proofs to the Utreexo design

-DeFi MOOC 2021 course article about propagation delay

-EGYPT NFTs:
This is still just an idea or suggestions (through a peer reviewed paper) to make NFTs and Metaverses for Egypt ancient heritage and civilizations stories, as a source of money to the country by for example selling NFTs instead of selling assets.
.
Hope to be continued....
